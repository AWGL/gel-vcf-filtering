# Genomics England VCF Variant Filtering

## Introduction

A pipeline to annotate and filter VCFs received from Genomics England (GeL). The pipeline does the following:

1) Merge the vcfs into a multi-sample vcf

2) Filter on an initial ROI - e.g. exome

3) Annotate the variants using VEP

4) Load these into a custom script for filtering and displaying to clinical scientists.
